                                                </div> - From the latest devblog #36<br />
                                                <br /> I don&#039;t really understand what Cowtrix is saying here, or what it means if he says what I think he is.<br /> After fridays patch we&#039;ll
                                                be able to spawn in <i>dynamic objects</i> - as in new objects to work as mineable Nodes? new AIs? Vehicles??<br />
                                                <br /> Would love a discussion and brainstorming around what this means, and what we can use it for.<br />
                                                <br /> Will these &quot;dynamic objects&quot; have to be spawned in trough custom made Oxide scripts? Meaning I can&#039;t make a level that has
                                                &quot;new minable nodes&quot; without either learning to Oxide script a function that spawns them in, or get someone here to do it for me.. And the
                                                server that runs a level will need to run oxide and the same script in order for the level to work as intended..?<br />
                                                <br /> PS. <a href="https://oxidemod.org/members/93398/" class="username" data-user="93398, @cowtrix">@cowtrix</a> How about getting a handfull of
                                                standard CS scripts added to the sdk? Some to control movement of objects, some to act as boolean triggers (aka player in area x play animation Y on
                                                object Z) - It should (as far as I understand) be a possible to do some sort of basic eventscripting from inside Unity without opening the core game up
                                                to be hackers paradise.<br /> Also I would love to be able to play sounds. And trigger them!<br />
                                                <br /> Last but not least, I&#039;m not sure I agree with you about &quot;I also brought all the other modding documentation up to date&quot;...
                                                I&#039;ve been messing around on making a map for several months now, and I&#039;m still so much just shooting in the dark when it comes to what is
                                                possible, what is not, and how to achieve different things that I think a PVE game level should be able to do.. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                                            <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Hey ZTIF - simply put, it&#039;s the beginnings of these things. Mineable nodes, Ais,
                                                vehicles, are all networked objects.<br />
                                                <br /> A simple use case - say I wanted a mod that spawned purple cubes all around the map. This would be pretty much impossible right now. You can
                                                make a bunch of cubes on the server through scripting, sure, but the client has no way to know about them. It&#039;ll just run into invisible
                                                colliders. This is because both the server and the client need to<i> know and agree</i> what things are, where they are, and what state they are in.
                                                Now, with these changes, you can make a mod for the Steam Workshop with a purple cube in it, add that mod to a server, and you&#039;ll be able to spawn
                                                purple cubes all over the place. All clients will be able to see them and agree what/where they are, collision will work properly, and nice things like
                                                that.<br />
                                                <br /> Now, we&#039;re slowly rolling out more functionality with these networked objects, but we can&#039;t rush it. When we push something out into
                                                the SDK, we&#039;re locking ourselves into a structure for that thing. We need to start thinking about things like backwards compatibility, and
                                                that&#039;s a whole ordeal. We&#039;re happy to do that with Construction stuff right now, because that&#039;s a system that&#039;s close to maturity.
                                                But things like vehicles, machines, minerals, all stuff which might be fundamentally changing in the near future, well there&#039;s not much point
                                                putting that into the SDK yet.<br />
                                                <br /> The first functionality, which should be good to go for this next patch and is probably the most general one, is what you refer to. Networked
                                                rigidbodies! This is a <i>type</i> of networked object, not all networked objects that you make have to be rigidbodies. But Networked Rigidbodies will
                                                do stuff like sync their position between server and client, and simulate physics if you want them to. You can make a big stack of purple cubes in your
                                                server and have them fall over! <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                                                You&#039;d need to manually calculate if players are overlapping the ball, and apply a depenetration force yourself. Totally doable though. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                                                getting closer to reality on friday. But it still seems to me like you&#039;re taking the long approach to things, and I&#039;m sure with good reason.
                                                <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" /><br />
                                                <br /> I have some animated objects in the level I&#039;m currently building, as these object currently aren&#039;t <i>networked, </i>what you&#039;re
                                                saying is that players joining the level at different times will get an animation that is de-synced from one another (they&#039;ll all see it, but not
                                                see the exact same). And if this object has a collider, it&#039;ll be acting weird. apparently stopping players with invisible colliders, and letting
                                                others pass through what seems static.. So now what I&#039;ll have to do instead is create a steam mod with this object, then use oxide to place it in
                                                the map at the coordinates where I need them?? There can&#039;t just be a checkbox in unity saying &#039;shigisync&#039;..?<br />
                                                <br /> I can manage to &quot;spawn&quot; a bunch of snowball rigidbodies in c# that moves the player around and kills him after x force has been
                                                applied - if I&#039;m using a player object with rigidbody and a collider - and I don&#039;t have to worry about this whole networked deal, which is a
                                                bit confusing.<br /> Simply put, I am nowhere close to &quot;manually calculate if players are overlapping the ball, and apply a depenetration force
                                                yourself&quot;. So I hope you are going to give this out with a set of <b>presets</b> for the poor people like me, who just want to make cool things
                                                happen, but aren&#039;t hardcore coders.<br />
                                                <br /> What I want to be able to do as a mapmaker is a lot of the times to &#039;script events&#039; that either deals with player stats/or the
                                                enviroment.<br /> - Open doors if player is in area x / object y is destroyed / interacted with. (press E)<br /> - Give player x amount of item y, if
                                                player is in area z (and t time has passed since last time..)<br /> - Give player x amount of wetness, dryness, coldness, radiation, poison, etc if
                                                player is colliding with y<br /> - Make bridge/iceflake/ledge unstable if player is on it. (aka play animation on trigger, like the door)<br />
                                                <br /> ..And I really, really just want to be able to do this from within Unity. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
