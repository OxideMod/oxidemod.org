					Hello, I am the owner of Rusted Gaming Community and I have 2 servers running oxide that are having the same issue. they start fine but at 10min of uptime they freeze or crash. they turn unresponsive and un-joinable. I cant even type in the console and they ping offline. I can&#039;t find any logs that give me any useful information but I did try to resolve this issue by rebuilding my servers from the ground up with no success. I also installed a new server to my machine that is completely vanilla and it runs fine. all servers are properly set up and have run in their current state untouched for 2 weeks before the wipe.<br />
<br />
Im thinking since it&#039;s basicly every 10min they crash and my save intervals are set to save every 5min then maybe its crashing on saves?<br />
<br />
I really need help with this issue ASAP as I have already lost all my dedicated players due to the ease of switching servers since every server just wiped.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need any more information, Thanks!<br />
<br />
Also the image below is what my frozen server looks like... pretty normal except frozen.<br />
<br />
OXIDE LOG:<br />

</div>Simple plugins are often the ons that cause the most errors since they dont handle data correctly. It could have run into a number of issues, OutOfBoundsExeption, RecursiveLoop, RefreneceErrors, BufferOverflow etc etc.<br />
<br />
I wrote a simple plugin to add ! command to the server to give players basic infomaton, like players online, uptime, report etc. The simple version done in about 50 lines cause the server to lag and have a ton of issues. The complex version with 500 lines has zero perforformance hit.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in code, simple and easy is not the best.

					So after restarting my servers again, they did the same thing. last night I spent 8 hours adding a plugin one by one and letting the server run for 20 minutes on each plugin. None of the plugins caused any issues so I removed LustyMap since it was acting a little strange. After removing that I started the servers and both have been running fine for 4 hours now. I&#039;m not confident enough to directly blame Lusty Map for the root of the issue and the issue may even still come back. we will see...
