</div>It&#039;s understandable: Check it&#039;s actually not generated by searching your seed/size @http://beancan.io/maps<br>
<br>
KillYou did say the following moments ago though: &quot;If your maps have the right seed and size but look wrong then chances are the map-gen is generating the wrong image. It happens sometimes and there is not much you can do about it other then report it and wait for a update.&quot;
