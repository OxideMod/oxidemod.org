                        <br /> KillYou did say the following moments ago though: &quot;If your maps have the right seed and size but look wrong then chances are the map-gen is generating the wrong
                        image. It happens sometimes and there is not much you can do about it other then report it and wait for a update.&quot; <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>
