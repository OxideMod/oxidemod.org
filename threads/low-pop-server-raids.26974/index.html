					I run my own 5x gather modded server and i want to know of any suggestions to extend the life of it. At the moment, players will often just leave because they get raided offline early on. What map size is ideal for 10-30 players throughout a wipe?<br />
currently i have a very small map (2.5k) so I&#039;m thinking this should be increased. but at the same time, this is why many players joined. I&#039;ve tried plugins like &#039;antiofflineraid&#039; but i ended up uninstalling it due to confusion.

					I&#039;ve experimented with a 2.5k map size on a 2x server. Players generally enjoy it more for the PvP aspect. But I recently changed it to 3k size map and it&#039;s doing much better.<br />
<br />
Reasonings:<br />
Think about it this way, image you are the player and get raided on a server. What would you do? Build a new base? Of course not, generally players don&#039;t enjoy rebuilding and restarting from the beginning on the same &quot;Old&quot; server.<br />
<br />
You have to take in count that majority of the content creators of rust on youtube and twitch are vanilla-encouraged by the media. Meaning people are less likely to take a server serious on a 2x, not to mention how much less they would care for a server that&#039;s a 5x server.<br />
<br />
Personal Reasons when joining a 5x server or more: It&#039;s just really a server I sit on to mess around and not care about anything after I get raided on the main server. That&#039;s what&#039;s always been on player&#039;s minds from my past 5000 hours of rust gaming. Now that I am hosting a server I can even understand and relate to.<br />
<br />
Things you have to take account into: Why are rustified and other old vanilla servers so popular and never die? They&#039;ve been the same exact thing since the beginning of rust. I mean, it&#039;s vanilla! Right? Since they&#039;ve existed from the start of the rust community it&#039;s the foundation of all rust youtubers/twitch streamers playground. They make all the videos and well edited contents on those servers based on that. So in order to maintain a good population and a fair amount of &quot;Loyal players&quot;. Because who cares about the 100 players that you get who leaves and never comes back after the first day of fame right?<br />
<br />
You might be wondering, why am I writing this. I was just bored really, I hold a server of my own on average of 40-30 players during the afternoons on my timezone. It&#039;s nothing big, but I&#039;ve been receiving donations enough to maintain and seek for customized plugins for the server hence which brings some sort of value for you to read through my suggestions.<br />
<br />
Edit: The whole point of this is to tell you that you have to be unique in your own ways. Not just some 5x server anyone can create. Try to think outside the box to seek for something else that might capture people&#039;s attention. IMPORTANT, you first need some sort of stable 10 player fanbase who comes on daily. All the things you might of thought of will not work just because it&#039;s been overused such as, events, plugins for arenas, ridiculous kits for players from the start. Flooding the server with excessive amount of plugins which will never work. Good luck <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />

					Thanks for your detailed response<br />
I will probably use a 3k map size next wipe, and i&#039;ll see how it goes. I feel although 5x is becoming more overpowered after all these updates to enhance vanilla, but that was the purpose of my server. I&#039;ve made it so that its nothing is overpowered in terms of plugins but there is many small mods i use.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve invested 200$ USD into plugins and i set them up according to my own and veteran player&#039;s experience and suggestions with modded servers. The kits are not overpowered at all and same goes with Stack limits ect. Its meant to be a casual player&#039;s type server,  so players can easily setup a base and experience the entirety of rust without spending hours on end gathering and running around. But, i have made changes to make it feel more like vanilla rust. (crafting time, smelting, loot spawn types)<br />
<br />
Many players agree that the server is very fun and easy to understand. I asked a few why they don&#039;t play anymore and they basically say its because they get raided too frequently and not enough people play.  Players end up fading off presumably because of continuous rebuilding like you said. No one is going to keep playing if one small group is just raiding everyone offline.<br />
<br />
But back to the topic of plugins, i don&#039;t exactly have anything ground-breaking except for maybe &quot;AutomatedSearchlights&quot;, &quot;FurnaceSorter&quot;and &quot;AbsolutSorter&quot; . none of which id consider directly makes the server more fun. i will probably look for something which makes the server more fun without making it confusing as i&#039;m trying to increase the player count. As for the raid problem, i&#039;ll increase the map size and if that doesn&#039;t work then i guess the only thing which can help is a lower gather rate.

					I don&#039;t recommend on starting a too high of a gather rate as your first server either. Although I&#039;m also like you, trying to get to that point and try to convince everyone to say goodbye to those old vanilla servers that don&#039;t do crap. All they do is just simply start up a server and pay for a good amount of money for the backend of their server performance. Like, where&#039;s the creativity for that.<br />
<br />
As for the gather rates, so we&#039;re on the same boat here, vanilla solo or duo feels like it just takes too long to even get something done for something simple as getting a semi-auto rifile. So what I did was I made the server 2x obviously, and adjusted the components to make things easier for the players. Increasing the spawnrates with spawn.min_rate 1 spawn.max_rate 3 spawn.min_density 1 and spawn.max_density 3. Then just add on some customized gifts every hour with well balance and always update players through my discord so they could feel and see that I actually care about them or what not.<br />
[DOUBLEPOST=1503965681][/DOUBLEPOST]As it is much harder to gain traffic from 2x in comparison to 5x. To my experience it&#039;s much more likely for a 2x server to gain loyalty as it would make things easier than vanilla, manages to get rid of the hard endless grind. But at the same time keep a balance of the game and still allow players to take it more &quot;serious&quot; in a way whereas in a 2x when you get a c4 it would still be something like &quot;ohhh, i got a C4&quot; verses the 5x &quot;I got 10 c4 lets just toss it in someone&#039;s houses&quot;.
