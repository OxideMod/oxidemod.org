                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> I&#039;ve experimented with a 2.5k map size on a 2x server. Players generally enjoy it more for the PvP aspect.
                        But I recently changed it to 3k size map and it&#039;s doing much better.<br />
                        <br /> Reasonings:<br /> Think about it this way, image you are the player and get raided on a server. What would you do? Build a new base? Of course not, generally players
                        don&#039;t enjoy rebuilding and restarting from the beginning on the same &quot;Old&quot; server.<br />
                        <br /> You have to take in count that majority of the content creators of rust on youtube and twitch are vanilla-encouraged by the media. Meaning people are less likely to take
                        a server serious on a 2x, not to mention how much less they would care for a server that&#039;s a 5x server.<br />
                        <br /> Personal Reasons when joining a 5x server or more: It&#039;s just really a server I sit on to mess around and not care about anything after I get raided on the main
                        server. That&#039;s what&#039;s always been on player&#039;s minds from my past 5000 hours of rust gaming. Now that I am hosting a server I can even understand and relate
                        to.<br />
                        <br /> Things you have to take account into: Why are rustified and other old vanilla servers so popular and never die? They&#039;ve been the same exact thing since the
                        beginning of rust. I mean, it&#039;s vanilla! Right? Since they&#039;ve existed from the start of the rust community it&#039;s the foundation of all rust youtubers/twitch
                        streamers playground. They make all the videos and well edited contents on those servers based on that. So in order to maintain a good population and a fair amount of
                        &quot;Loyal players&quot;. Because who cares about the 100 players that you get who leaves and never comes back after the first day of fame right?<br />
                        <br /> You might be wondering, why am I writing this. I was just bored really, I hold a server of my own on average of 40-30 players during the afternoons on my timezone.
                        It&#039;s nothing big, but I&#039;ve been receiving donations enough to maintain and seek for customized plugins for the server hence which brings some sort of value for you to
                        read through my suggestions.<br />
                        <br /> Edit: The whole point of this is to tell you that you have to be unique in your own ways. Not just some 5x server anyone can create. Try to think outside the box to seek
                        for something else that might capture people&#039;s attention. IMPORTANT, you first need some sort of stable 10 player fanbase who comes on daily. All the things you might of
                        thought of will not work just because it&#039;s been overused such as, events, plugins for arenas, ridiculous kits for players from the start. Flooding the server with
                        excessive amount of plugins which will never work. Good luck <img src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" />

                    <blockquote class="messageText SelectQuoteContainer ugc baseHtml"> Thanks for your detailed response<br /> I will probably use a 3k map size next wipe, and i&#039;ll see how it
                        goes. I feel although 5x is becoming more overpowered after all these updates to enhance vanilla, but that was the purpose of my server. I&#039;ve made it so that its nothing
                        is overpowered in terms of plugins but there is many small mods i use.<br />
                        <br /> I&#039;ve invested 200$ USD into plugins and i set them up according to my own and veteran player&#039;s experience and suggestions with modded servers. The kits are not
                        overpowered at all and same goes with Stack limits ect. Its meant to be a casual player&#039;s type server, so players can easily setup a base and experience the entirety of
                        rust without spending hours on end gathering and running around. But, i have made changes to make it feel more like vanilla rust. (crafting time, smelting, loot spawn
                        types)<br />
                        <br /> Many players agree that the server is very fun and easy to understand. I asked a few why they don&#039;t play anymore and they basically say its because they get raided
                        too frequently and not enough people play. Players end up fading off presumably because of continuous rebuilding like you said. No one is going to keep playing if one small
                        group is just raiding everyone offline.<br />
                        <br /> But back to the topic of plugins, i don&#039;t exactly have anything ground-breaking except for maybe &quot;AutomatedSearchlights&quot;, &quot;FurnaceSorter&quot;and
                        &quot;AbsolutSorter&quot; . none of which id consider directly makes the server more fun. i will probably look for something which makes the server more fun without making it
                        confusing as i&#039;m trying to increase the player count. As for the raid problem, i&#039;ll increase the map size and if that doesn&#039;t work then i guess the only thing
                        which can help is a lower gather rate. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;</div>

                        also like you, trying to get to that point and try to convince everyone to say goodbye to those old vanilla servers that don&#039;t do crap. All they do is just simply start up
                        a server and pay for a good amount of money for the backend of their server performance. Like, where&#039;s the creativity for that.<br />
                        <br /> As for the gather rates, so we&#039;re on the same boat here, vanilla solo or duo feels like it just takes too long to even get something done for something simple as
                        getting a semi-auto rifile. So what I did was I made the server 2x obviously, and adjusted the components to make things easier for the players. Increasing the spawnrates with
                        spawn.min_rate 1 spawn.max_rate 3 spawn.min_density 1 and spawn.max_density 3. Then just add on some customized gifts every hour with well balance and always update players
                        through my discord so they could feel and see that I actually care about them or what not.<br /> [DOUBLEPOST=1503965681][/DOUBLEPOST]As it is much harder to gain traffic from
                        2x in comparison to 5x. To my experience it&#039;s much more likely for a 2x server to gain loyalty as it would make things easier than vanilla, manages to get rid of the hard
                        endless grind. But at the same time keep a balance of the game and still allow players to take it more &quot;serious&quot; in a way whereas in a 2x when you get a c4 it would
                        still be something like &quot;ohhh, i got a C4&quot; verses the 5x &quot;I got 10 c4 lets just toss it in someone&#039;s houses&quot;. <div class="messageTextEndMarker">&nbsp;
